\section{Accurator framework}
\label{architecture}
Our assumptions for the nichesourcing process are the following. 
We assume that personalizing the nichesourcing process increases the quality of the annotations. 
We assume we can use specific techniques to identify niches and create user profiles. 
% MT: Can we use a different term than "user profiles" here? It might be misleading. What about "expert profiles" or "expertise profiles"? 
Based on the user profiles we assume that we can recommend relevant tasks to the user and apply trust mechanisms to motivate users, provide feedback and improve the recommendations.  
We build the Accurator framework upon these assumptions and we use it to solve the aforementioned challenges.
