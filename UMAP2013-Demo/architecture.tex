Using the Accurator framework we try to solve the aforementioned challenges. In this stadium of the work, we try to understand and model the properties and behaviour of candidate users. Figure 1 shows the cycle of the behavior of the framework in respect to a candidate user. A candidate is, based on his or her Social Web data, identified and motivated to use the application, after which the candidate becomes a user in the system. A user profile is automatically built from available data which the user can extend and improve. Based on that user profile, relevant tasks, the annotation or reviewing of items, are recommended. The user then annotates and/or reviews a recommended item. The results of that task are processed by the framework and the user profile is updated accordingly. The updated user profile is then again the basis to recommend tasks to the user. Statistics about the performance of the user and the system are gathered and selected statistics are shown to the user for feedback and motivation.
