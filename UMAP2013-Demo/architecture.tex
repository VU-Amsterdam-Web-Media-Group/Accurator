\section{Accurator framework}
\label{architecture}
Our assumptions for the niche sourcing process are the following. We assume that personalizing the niche sourcing process increases the quality of the annotations. We assume we can use specific techniques to identify niches and create user profiles. Based on the user profiles we assume we can recommend relevant tasks to the user and apply trust mechanisms to motivate users, provide feedback and improve the recommendations.  We have build the Accurator framework upon these assumptions and use it to solve the aforementioned challenges.
